need to format cointegration test for 90 days rolling instead of entire dataset

--> then we upload to db with same test date for each pair


epsilon test:
    -->calculate z-score based on 90 day rolling mean and std
    --> find optimal z score entry and exits based on historical data
    --> each entry and exit's z score is between +-2 and +-1 and goes to +-1 and 0 and is tested in increments of 0.1
    --> calculate the reversion success rate based on z-scores to find optimal z-score entry and exit for trading pair
    --store these in DB for a trading pair


trade_window table
    id primary key INT
    ticker_id1 INT
    ticker_id2 INT
    optimal_zscore REAL
    optimal_reversions INT
    optimal_reversion_success INT
    start_date DATE
    end_date DATE
    trade_type BOOL
    unique constraint tickerid_1 ticker_id2 start_date end_date

options
Based on ticker and date from trade window table find option price 
upload to db 


calculate pnl based on trade 
option price compared to start end date price 




MonteCarlo simulation
    --> based on a unique pair A and B find other historical points
