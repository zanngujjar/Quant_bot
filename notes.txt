need to format cointegration test for 90 days rolling instead of entire dataset

--> then we upload to db with same test date for each pair


epsilon test:
    -->calculate z-score based on 90 day rolling mean and std
    --> find optimal z score entry and exits based on historical data
    --> each entry and exit's z score is between +-2 and +-1 and goes to +-1 and 0 and is tested in increments of 0.1
    --> calculate the reversion success rate based on z-scores to find optimal z-score entry and exit for trading pair
    --store these in DB for a trading pair

MonteCarlo simulation
    --> based on a unique pair A and B find other historical points
